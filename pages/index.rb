	 				# Introduction

					Phlex is a framework for building fast, reusable, testable views in pure Ruby.

					## Better developer experience ðŸ’ƒ

					Phlex views are plain old Ruby objects. View classes are just Ruby classes, templates are just methods, and HTML tags are just method calls. If you know how to define a method that calls another method, you pretty much already know how to use Phlex.

					## Better safety ðŸ¥½

					Phlex view templates render in an isolated execution context where only the instance variables and methods for the specific view are exposed.

					## Better performance ðŸ”¥

					Rendering a Phlex view is ~4.35Ã— faster than an ActionView partial and ~2Ã— faster than ViewComponent component.
